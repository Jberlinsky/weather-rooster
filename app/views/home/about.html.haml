  %h2 Frequently Asked Questions

  %h4 What forecast data do you check and when?

  %p Every day at noon local time, we check the forecast high for the next day and the forecast low for the night following the next day.

  %h4 How do you score the data?

  %p  We take the most recent data in the last 30 days, and calculate the Pearson coefficient between the forecasts of a given service and the observed weather.  We take the mean of the Pearson coefficients of the high temperatures and the low temperatures, and multiply it by 100 to get our accuracy score.
